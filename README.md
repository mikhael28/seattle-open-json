## üìã Overview

Seattle Youth Open Data provides structured, machine-readable information about youth initiatives, community resources, and recreational opportunities in the Seattle area. This package includes both raw data collections and comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type-safe development.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install seattle-open-json
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import seattleYouthData, {
  communityCenters,
  farmersMarkets,
  parksCatalog,
  allSeattleData,
} from "seattle-open-json";

// Get all data as a structured object
const allData = seattleYouthData.data;

// Access specific data collections
const centers = communityCenters;
const markets = farmersMarkets;
const parks = parksCatalog;

// Get combined datasets
const recreationSpots = seattleYouthData.opportunities.recreation;
const communityResources = seattleYouthData.opportunities.community;

// Get metadata
console.log(seattleYouthData.metadata);
```

### Working with Specific Data Types

```javascript
import {
  communityCenters,
  mobileRecreationProgramming,
  pPatch,
  picnicSites,
  youth_programs,
} from "seattle-open-json";

// Find open community centers
const openCenters = communityCenters.filter(
  center => center["Open Status"] === "Open"
);

// Find active recreation programs
const activePrograms = mobileRecreationProgramming.filter(
  program => program["Program Status"] === "Active"
);

// Find P-Patch gardens in specific neighborhoods
const magnoliaPatches = pPatch.filter(
  patch => patch.NEIGHB_NAME === "Magnolia"
);

// Find youth programs by age range
const teenPrograms = youth_programs.filter(
  program => program.ageRange.includes("13") || program.ageRange.includes("teen")
);

// Find free youth programs
const freePrograms = youth_programs.filter(
  program => program.cost.toLowerCase().includes("free")
);
```

### TypeScript Support

Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions:

```typescript
import {
  CommunityCenter,
  FarmersMarket,
  MobileRecreationProgramming,
  PPatch,
  PicnicSite,
  PrivatelyOwnedPublicSpace,
  ParksCatalog,
  YouthProgram as YouthProgramInterface,
  YouthOpportunity,
  YouthProgram as YouthProgramHSDS,
  SportsOpportunity,
  youth_programs,
} from "seattle-open-json";

// Type-safe data access
function findOpenCenters(centers: CommunityCenter[]): CommunityCenter[] {
  return centers.filter(center => center["Open Status"] === "Open");
}

// Working with HSDS-compliant data
function processYouthPrograms(programs: YouthProgramHSDS[]): YouthProgramHSDS[] {
  return programs.filter(program => program.ageRange.min >= 13);
}

// Working with structured youth programs
function findProgramsByAge(programs: YouthProgramInterface[], ageQuery: string): YouthProgramInterface[] {
  return programs.filter(program => program.ageRange.includes(ageQuery));
}

// Type-safe geographic data
function findNearbyParks(parks: ParksCatalog[], zipCode: string): ParksCatalog[] {
  return parks.filter(park => park.ZIP_CODE === zipCode);
}
```
