The Employer Engagement team will review applications for completion. If we require any additional information, we will reach out before our application deadline. Once the deadline has passed, we will begin our matching process in early May with the prospective interns.

By mid-May, we will reach out to all prospective employer sites regarding their application status. Those who receive an intern will be able to then check in the Employer Portal (using your User Account login) and indicate how many youth have been placed and their contact information. If you have been selected to host an intern, you will follow the steps below for Internship Readiness.

**Internship Readiness Steps:**

1.   Complete, sign, and submit the Agency Agreement Contract, Supervisor Agreement, and Background Check all via our Adobe Sign webforms provided to you in the Next Steps e-mail.
2.   Participate in a site visit where one of our dedicated staff members will review your completed, signed paperwork, go over logistics, and preview the space interns will be occupying.
3.   Plan and share the work plan you envision for the intern(s). You can submit your workplan or first week plenary with your assigned SYEP staff member.
4.   Attend all required site supervisor trainings hosted by the SYEP program team.

_Please note, as much as we would like to host every interested employer, we cannot guarantee placement of interns at every site due to intern onboarding completion, intern removal or dropping from program, and/or a limited number of interns or interest in a particular internship._

### Facilitate as a Subject Matter Expert

If you have an area of expertise that you would like to share with our program participants, we offer a Learn and Earn program during the fall to springtime during which we facilitate weekly workshops on career and job skill development. Some examples of workshops facilitated in previous cohort years and are of interest to our participants are:

*   Entrepreneurship
*   Financial Literacy
*   Imposter Syndrome
*   “A Day in the Life” (in a specific role)
*   Healthy Relationships
*   Code Switching
*   Interviewing

If there are any other ways you would like to support SYEP youth (e.g., mentorship, job shadowing), please reach out to our engagement team via e-mail: [syepemprelations@seattle.gov](mailto:syepemprelations@seattle.gov "SYEP Employer Relations E-mail").

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Can I be turning 16 and still apply?
------------------------------------

You must be 16 years old before the start date of the program you are applying to. So, you may be 15 years old at the time you submit your application.

Do I need a social security number (SSN) or an individual taxpayer identification (ITIN) number to participate?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**For our Learn and Earn: Foundations and Pathways Program**, this is not a requirement to participate but to receive any compensation for participation (stipend) you will need a valid SSN or ITIN.

**For our Internship Program**, we require you to provide [proof of authorization to work in the U.S.](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents "Form I-9 Acceptable Documents") Without a SSN or ITIN, you will not be able to participate in the Internship Program.

What types of internships are there?
------------------------------------

Internships change every year. Internship development is an ongoing process and jobs are added frequently. We offer positions in office administration, information technology (IT), childcare, medical, restaurant, retail, construction, camp counseling, community art projects, and more!

We are always looking to create new relationships with companies and community organizations. Refer employers you know to our program.

What do I need to do after I apply?
-----------------------------------

*   Someone on the SYEP team should follow up with you within three weeks of your application submission regarding whether your application is complete (meaning you have submitted all required eligibility documents and they have been verified). To view next steps after you submit your application, view the [Youth Applicant Pre-Program Checklist](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/HumanServices/Youth/SYEP-Youth-Applicant-Pre-Program-Checklist.pdf).
*   Additionally, our application is usually open for at least a month and since gathering eligibility documents and uploading it to our Youth Portal can be difficult for some, our SYEP staff provide support to applicants for at least a week after the application closes. This is why you may not hear from us for a while after the application closes but we will send you an email update when the next admissions phase begins!
*   For the Internship Program, once applications have closed and employer host recruitment is complete, the SYEP team will reach out to you with the next steps. View this document on [How to Select Your Internship Preferences](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/HumanServices/Youth/Select-Your-Internship-Preferences.pdf) to review the internship opportunities and rank your choices for consideration!
