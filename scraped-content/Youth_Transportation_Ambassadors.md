Background and History
----------------------

**In 2019**, we launched the Youth Transportation Ambassadors Program. This program is funded by the [Seattle Transit Measure](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/transit-program/seattle-transit-measure). Through this program, we partnered with two community-based organizations (CBOs) to teach youth leaders about public transit options, and to help youth become transit ambassadors in their community.

**In 2022**, we partnered with the [Seattle Youth Employment Program (SYEP)](https://www.seattle.gov/human-services/services-and-programs/youth-and-young-adults/seattle-youth-employment-program) to launch the Youth Ambassador Program as part of SYEP’s Learn and Earn: Career Pathways track.

**In 2023**, we decided to reevaluate the structure of the Youth Ambassador program and paused it for 2024.
