About
=====

Seattle Promise is a college tuition and success program launched by Seattle Colleges, Seattle Public Schools, and the City of Seattle following passage of the [Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy (opens in new tab)](https://www.seattle.gov/education/big-initiatives/fepp-levy) in 2018.

Seattle Promise has three core components:

*   **Free tuition** at any of the Seattle Colleges: [North Seattle College](https://northseattle.edu/), [Seattle Central College](https://seattlecentral.edu/) or [South Seattle College](https://southseattle.edu/) for up to two years, 90 college credits or a student's first degree, whichever comes first.

[A Program and a Promise](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/about#collapse-accordion-10761-1)

### The program is a promise to:

*   Guide students on a direct path from high school to college to earn a degree or certificate and enter the workforce or transfer to a four-year college or university;
*   Boost career opportunities for all students, especially first-generation and under-served populations; and,
*   Prepare students to participate in our region's vibrant workforce and economy without taking on overwhelming debt.

[The Need](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/about#collapse-accordion-10761-2)

In today’s labor market, a post-secondary degree, credential or certificate is more important than ever in finding a living-wage job. By 2020, it’s estimated that 70 percent of jobs in Washington will require some form of post-secondary education, yet only 31 percent of high school students in Washington earn a post-secondary credential by the age of 26.

[Holistic Design](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/about#collapse-accordion-10761-3)

More Than a Scholarship
-----------------------

Seattle Promise is designed to prepare students for career success and increase the number of Seattle public high school graduates earning certificates, credentials, and degrees. The program provides financial support as well as ongoing college and career guidance for students to attend one of three Seattle Colleges ([North](https://northseattle.edu/), [Central](https://seattlecentral.edu/), and [South](https://southseattle.edu/)).

Seattle Promise scholars receive the following services:

*   Support applying to Seattle Promise and Seattle Colleges ([North](https://northseattle.edu/), [Central](https://seattlecentral.edu/) or [South](https://southseattle.edu/))
*   Support applying for and completing financial aid requirements
*   Full coverage of any tuition expenses remaining after other scholarships and financial aid
*   Assistance with choosing and registering for classes
*   Preparation for the transition to college
*   Guidance and mentorship through the first two years of college

Holistic Program Design
-----------------------

Many programs cover college tuition. Some fund school-related expenses. Few offer individual guidance and advising. Seattle Promise, by design and proven student success, combines all three.

And, just as uniquely, the program also extends the opportunity for all Seattle public high school graduates regardless of GPA, income or country of birth.

### 1. Tuition Scholarship

Seattle Promise covers any remaining tuition balance for up to two years (or 90 credits) at one of the Seattle Colleges after other public funding, grants or scholarships a student may be eligible to receive have been applied.

### 2. Individual Support & Guidance

Dedicated success specialists guide scholars from high school through college graduation offering assistance with financial aid and admissions applications, class selection and registration. Specialists also partner with college-access programs at Seattle Public Schools and the greater community. Students have increased access to advisors (100:1 ratio vs. 600:1) and meet once a quarter to develop and check-in on their educational plans and goals. Scholars have peer support becoming part of a group that share their first college experiences together and often take the same classes.

### 3. Financial Assistance for College Costs Beyond Tuition

Additional financial support for college costs beyond tuition including school-related expenses such as books, child care, food, housing, and transportation are available through the Seattle Promise Equity Scholarship for students with a demonstrated financial need.

The program continues to evolve as more needs are identified, including providing students with career and work experience through Opportunity Promise, a summer internship program as well as exploring transfer partnerships with four year universities.

[Program Funding and How the Scholarship Works](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/about#collapse-accordion-10761-5)

Seattle Promise is jointly funded by the City of Seattle’s [Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy](https://www.seattle.gov/education/fepp-levy)and from private and public partnerships through the Seattle Colleges Foundation.

Contributions to[establish an endowment fund](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/support)will sustain the Seattle Promise today and into the future when the City of Seattle’s supporting education levy sunsets after its seven-year term.

### Seattle Promise complements other aid programs while addressing gaps.

After other aid programs are applied toward tuition, Seattle Promise fills in the gaps. The program, in addition to tuition support, provides essential resources for student success and completion as well as a secondary equity scholarship for financial support outside tuition (for low-income students). These aids and supports are available to **all Seattle Public School graduates**.

Generally, other aid programs such as the [Washington College Grant](https://readysetgrad.wa.gov/college/washington-college-grant#:~:text=The%20Washington%20College%20Grant%20%28WCG%29%20program%20%28formerly%20State,eligible%20for%20WCG%20must%20meet%20the%20following%20criteria%3A)program, [Washington State Opportunity Scholarship](https://www.waopportunityscholarship.org/) and [King County’s Supporting Postsecondary Success](https://www.psccn.org/transition/king-county-promise) program are focused on tuition support for a specific population of students.

### Important Information About the Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy

Seattle Promise is funded, in large part, through the [Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy](https://www.seattle.gov/education/fepp-levy), passed by Seattle voters in November 2018. This levy provides funding for Seattle Promise and other educational services in the city. The FEPP Levy was established on a 7-year life cycle and is set for a vote to renew on Nov. 4, 2025.

Class of 2025 Seattle Promise scholars are currently funded for one academic year (Fall 2025-Spring 2026). For information about the FEPP levy and the 2025 levy vote, visit the [Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL)](https://www.seattle.gov/education/fepp-levy).

[Program History](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/about#collapse-accordion-10761-6)

In 2018, Seattle Colleges partnered with the City of Seattle and Seattle Public Schools to launch Seattle Promise, a scholarship program focused on providing college access, success, and completion with the overarching mission of building a local thriving, college-going culture that creates a workforce ready for our region's careers.

The program, informed and inspired by South Seattle College's [13th Year](https://www.southseattle.edu/13th-year/) scholarship, expanded in reach and impact with the passing of the [Families and Education levy (opens in new tab)](https://www.seattle.gov/education/about-us/about-the-levy) in November 2018.

In 2020, Seattle Promise expanded from six to all seventeen Seattle public high schools. Graduates are now eligible to receive up to two years (or 90 credits) of free tuition, plus additional funding for low income students who need assistance with books and other expenses and increased support through academic counseling, internship opportunities, college transfer partnerships, and more.

[Partners and Organization](https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/promise/about#collapse-accordion-10761-7)

Seattle Promise is jointly managed by the city of Seattle, Seattle Colleges, and Seattle Public Schools. These organization are supported by Seattle’s [Levy Oversight Committee (opens in new tab)](https://www.seattle.gov/education/about-us/about-the-levy/levy-oversight), established by the city council to review and make recommendations regarding levy-funded programs including Seattle Promise.

Seattle Colleges and the Seattle Department of Education and Early Learning annually review the program's performance indicators to measure the quality and quantity of services to Seattle Promise students.
