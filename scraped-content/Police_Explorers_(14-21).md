Police Explorers
================

The mission of the Seattle Police Law Enforcement Exploring program is to bridge the gap between youth and police by educating and involving them in police operations and to interest them in Law Enforcement.

#### Exploring is for young men and women 14 to 21 years of age

Exploring can:

*   Further each Explorer's education
*   Encourage the Explorer's participation in a rewarding and productive service activity
*   Enhance the Explorer's preparation for future roles as citizen and community members.

Besides gaining a working knowledge of police work, the participants have the opportunity to give of themselves to their community.

#### Benefits

Being an Explorer offers many opportunities to learn valuable leadership and life skills, make new friends, interact with the public. The program has helped some achieve a career in policing.

#### What do Explorers do?

Explorers have many opportunities to apply the training they receive during monthly meetings. For example, members volunteer at community events doing security work, directing traffic and providing overall community service.

Members can also learn first hand how Police Officers do their jobs. Officers and Detectives with special skills are invited to meetings to explain how the Police Department investigates major crimes such as Homicides, Narcotics Violations and Gang Activity. Explorers also make in-person visits to such units as K-9 and Harbor Patrol.

#### What do Explorers learn?

Law enforcement posts conduct a variety of programs and projects featuring safety, training, and service. The following listing is an example of some of the activities and training in which the Explorers may participate.

*   The history of law enforcement
*   Introduction to law enforcement
*   Note taking and study habits
*   Patrol procedures
*   Traffic control
*   Accident investigation and forms
*   Criminal investigation
*   Crime scene investigation
*   Vice and narcotics
*   Organized crime
*   Homicide
*   Crime lab
*   Search and arrest procedures
*   Defensive weapons
*   Custody
*   Fingerprint lifting
*   Fingerprint classifications
*   Domestic complaints
*   Crowd control procedures
*   Riot control procedures

#### Who is eligible?

You are eligible to be an Explorer if you are:

*   Between 14 and 21 years of age
*   You are registered as a full-time student with a grade point average of 2.5 or above
*   You have not been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor
*   You can successfully pass a minimum background check and oral interview

#### How do I join?

Explorers meet monthly. If you would like to attend a meeting please contact Officer Tre Smith at [tre.smith@seattle.gov](mailto:tre.smith@seattle.gov)

*   Candidates interested in becoming Explorers must attend 2 - 4 monthly meetings in succession.
*   Upon attending the initial meetings, they are given an application. Upon receipt of the completed application, a background check is done on the applicant.
*   Finally, an oral board is given by a panel of existing Explorers for a final evaluation.
*   At the successful completion of these procedures, the candidate becomes an Explorer. 

There will be a minimum of two meetings per month in which Explorers are required to attend. In addition to these two meetings, Explorers are required to participate in a minimum of one community event per month. Failure to fulfill these requirements may result in the termination of Explorer standing with the Post.
