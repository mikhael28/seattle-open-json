Our Why
-------

We want to ensure no young person feels alone in their depression.
------------------------------------------------------------------

The number of adolescents reporting poor mental health is dangerously high and we want to be part of the solution by tackling the crisis at its roots.

**Erika’s Lighthouse stands as a beacon of hope for adolescent depression.**

We make mental health education and resources 100% free of cost and accessible all with the click of a button. Providing evidence-informed mental health, depression education and suicide prevention curriculum can help us ensure that every school can equip its students with the tools they need to thrive.

Educating students, empowering youth, engaging families, and training staff can allow us to Get Depression Out of the Dark.
