### How Local Businesses Can Help

Our Employment and Training team at the Y Social Impact Center provides youth and young adults in our programs with internships with local businesses. We partner with these organizations to bring them fresh, new faces ready to start work in a particular industry, and the best part is the employer doesn't need to pay a dime! The Y retains all liabilities and financial responsibility, while you get all of the benefits of having an intern. We work with youth and young adults ages 17-24 that struggle with disadvantages such as poverty, racism, foster care, and more.

If you own or operate a business and are interested in partnering with the Y Social Impact Center please email us to discuss next steps, program specifics, and expectations at [EAT@seattleymca.org](mailto:EAT@seattleymca.org).
