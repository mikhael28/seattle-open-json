### Not currently accepting applications

Thank you for your interest in the Student Assistant Program. We are not accepting applications at this time. This page will be updated when information is available about the next expected application period. Please contact Human Resources at [job.applications@spl.org](mailto:job.applications@spl.org "job.applications@spl.org") with any questions.

### Who can participate

To be eligible for the Student Assistant Program, you must be at least 16 years old, currently enrolled in high school, college (undergraduate), vocational school, or a G.E.D. program.

Student Assistants work at the Library from 12 to 15 hours per week. Their positions are temporary and can be held for up to two years (if they are enrolled in school).

High school students must be available to work for a minimum of four consecutive months. Undergraduate students must be available to work for a minimum of three consecutive academic quarters/semesters.

If you would like to learn more about the Student Assistant Program, [watch the 'Hacks for Getting a Student Job at the Library' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV-7bb-fLdA "View video") on our YouTube page. This information session took place on January 5, 2022.

### How you can prepare for the required skills assessment

Before you take the assessments, you will have a chance to study for and take practice versions of the assessments. To help you prepare for the required skills assessment exercises we are including several resources below. (Note that many of these resources are from other library systems. Shelves at The Seattle Public Library may look slightly different.)

**Study Materials:** The following links for videos and games will help you become familiar with the systems the Library uses to shelve materials and will help you prepare to take the required skills assessment exercises.

**Videos:**

*   [Shelving Non Fiction Library Books](https://youtu.be/l3WCZiVsDDY?si=_zj8TMAE10SpsfIl "View video"): How to shelve nonfiction books in order by call number (a call number is like an address--it tells us where to find items in the library.)
*   [Shelving Fiction Library Books](https://youtu.be/iVUoPMGnz8Q?si=Gna-ulymsH0EmhJ2 "View video"): How to shelve fiction books in order by call number.

**Games:**

*   [Shelver](https://shelver.mrs-lodges-library.com/ "Visit Shelver"): Practice placing fiction and Dewey (nonfiction) books in order with increasing levels of difficulty.
*   [Game](https://sixthformstudyskills.ncl.ac.uk/libraries/game-dewey-decimal/ "Visit Dewey Decimal Game"): Dewey Decimal: Practice placing nonfiction books in order with a time limit.
