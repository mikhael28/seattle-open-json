    Description:
      "This player has had some tennis instruction, and/or has progressed from the 1.5 Beginner level. This class is for players that are continuing to work on their rallying skills and have limited playing experience. GROUP CLASS IS GENERALLY MORE TECHNICAL, AND LESS TACTICAL (MORE LEARNING THE SKILLS). This player can rally an average of 4-6 balls with a partner, but needs guidance with directional control, stroke technique, the correct grips, and footwork. This player can also make volley contact but feels uncomfortable at the net. Additionally, this class is for players that are almost ready for competitive play but need some help on scoring and playing a match. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval. In the case that a player signs up at the wrong level, the tennis center will try to find an appropriate leveled class, but there is no guarantee due to available space.",

      "This class is for players that can sustain a minimum rally of 6-8 balls at slow pace with either forehand or backhand (with player of same ability); however, consistency and court coverage is still a concern. GROUP CLASS IS GENERALLY MORE TECHNICAL, AND LESS TACTICAL (MORE LEARNING THE SKILLS). The class will focus on directional/depth intent, stroke mechanics, and net play. This player can volley but is still more comfortable at the baseline and won't come to the net voluntarily. Players feel uncomfortable with their serve but can still make 50% of them. Lastly, this player can score and could play a formal USTA match. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval. In the case that a player signs up at the wrong level, the tennis center will try to find an appropriate leveled class, but there is no guarantee due to available space.This class will be a 5-class session. There is NO class on Thursday, March 6th due to a staff in-service. Price is reflective of this.",

      "This class is for players that can sustain a minimum rally of 12-16 balls at medium to face pace, and can effectively execute directional control, power, and placement. PLAY INSTRUCTS ARE GENERALLY MORE TACTICAL, AND LESS TECHNICAL (MORE APPLYING THE SKILLS). This class is generally more geared towards doubles play. Tactical and technical understanding is there but can use some tweaking. Varying spins and trajectories can be placed on a ball, but rallies may be lost due to impatience. This player can control serve placement if needed and can force errors with this placement. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval. In the case that a player signs up at the wrong level, the tennis center will try to find an appropriate leveled class, but there is no guarantee due to available space. Students may only register for classes at their skill level, and NOT multiple classes at varying skill levels. Classes limited to six players and current COVID safety protocols in place. AYTC will also be adhering to USTA?s ?Playing Tennis Safely? guidance. In line with CDC guidelines, do not play if you have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days and/or if you are exhibiting any symptoms of coronavirus.",

      "This class is a progression from Advanced Beginner Orange Ball, and for our tennis stars that are solidifying their rallying skills on both forehand and backhand sides. In order to enter this class, students must be able to rally with the coach a minimum of 15 times in a row, including at least 3 backhands from the 60? baseline. Being able to demonstrate ready position, proper technique in forehand and backhand preparation and follow-through, and making line calls are needed. This student should be starting to consider playing competitively in tournaments or match play. Student will be playing on 60? tennis court. In addition to being able to drop and hit a tennis ball into an intended area, students should be able to cooperatively rally 8 balls in a row with a classmate. Lastly, students must be able to hit 4 out of 10 serves (can be underhand). Coaches will continue to work on bettering the student?s serve and providing guidance for technical corrections on all strokes. Students can expect mini drills, points, and exciting games. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval. Students may only register for classes at their skill level, and NOT multiple classes at varying skill levels.",

In addition to this, the player will learn the correct grips, court positioning, and how to keep the ball in play to have a rally. Students may only register for classes at their skill level, and NOT multiple classes at varying skill levels. This class will be a 5-class session. There is NO class on Thursday, March 6th due to a staff on-service. Price is reflective of this.",

Players can hit volleys with the correct grip but tend  to stay at baseline because of inconsistency issues. This player understands  court positioning and is beginning to understand basic tactics in competitive  play. Lastly, this player has a dependable second serve.

      "This class is for players that can sustain a minimum rally of 10-15 balls at medium pace with forehand or backhand and can mix in different spins throughout a rally. PLAY INSTRUCTS ARE GENERALLY MORE TACTICAL, AND LESS TECHNICAL (MORE APPLYING THE SKILLS). This class is generally more geared towards doubles play. Players have improved directional control and power and are developing better spin. Players still struggle to control/produce faster paced, deep or high shots, but are improving. Court coverage & positioning are improved and is starting to look for opportunities to come to the net, especially in doubles. Starting to serve with improved power and control and is developing spin ? especially on second serves. Exhibits improved net play, but still struggles to put volleys away. Students can only advance with instructor or manager approval. In the case that a player signs up at the wrong level, the tennis center will try to find an appropriate leveled class, but there is no guarantee due to available space. Students may only register for classes at their skill level, and NOT multiple classes at varying skill levels.",

Learn the specifics of what to eat based on the work of Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr., the author of "Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease", in this fun-filled class that teaches how to set-up your kitchen, grocery shop, and prepared healthy meals. We\'ll learn how to make meals and snacks come together quickly and easily, and cover tips for eating out successfully, being a guest for meals, how to use an instant pot and more. The class is taught by a retired high school teacher who uses entertaining resources from notable plant-based leaders: Chef AJ, psychologist Dr. Doug Lisle, nutritionist Jeff Novick and Dr. Esselstyn and his family. Bonus: this way of eating can also lead to achieving and maintaining optimal weight. Note: We will not be cooking in this class, but some samples will be provided.  Instructor: Jeanie O',

      "Where Does It Go?\" will outline all Recology's requirements for sorting trash, recycle, and compost waste, as well as how the Materials Recovery Facility operates so folks can understand what they're looking at when they're on the machine. We will then open discussion about the solid waste industry, and any specific questions people have about how to safely dispose of certain items. Followed by a 30 to 45-minute stroll through the Materials Recovery Facility where everyone can see it in action, and how it works. Visitors should wear closed-toed shoes and no loose-fitting clothing. The MRF is often dirty, so we recommend not wearing your best clothes. There is walking on several sets of stairs. There is currently no wheelchair access available on the operating machine. We do however have a viewing room where you can see a few parts of the MRF, in case folks need to stay behind.  Pick up is at Densmore   Building, 8061 Densmore Ave N. at 9:10 am and Jefferson Community Center at 9:40.",
