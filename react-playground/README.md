## Seattle Open JSON Playground

The first page is a simple playground to work through the data, and then there is the Emerald City Resource Guide.

The third page is a guided ADU development plan, that gives you resources on how to get information about the property in question.

The fourth page is the prototype of a Site Map Designer, which is probably going to go the way of the dodo. It would need to be dramatically simplified, to simply serve as a quick prototyping issue.
